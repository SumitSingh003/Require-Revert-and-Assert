# Functions and Errors

Require, Revert and Assert

## Description

The `Err` contract is a simple Solidity contract designed to demonstrate the use of error handling mechanisms in Solidity: `require`, `revert`, and `assert`. It includes functions that trigger these mechanisms based on certain conditions.

## Executing program

* Copy the code and paste it on remix.etherum.org
* Make sure it is compatible with the current version of the compiler
* Compile the code (or press 'ctrl + S' for compilation)
* Deploy the contract (Compile and Deploy options are on the left side of the screen)
* Use the deployed contract as per your wish.

## Help

Make sure the contract is compatible with the current version of your compiler. (>=0.8.7 is common)
